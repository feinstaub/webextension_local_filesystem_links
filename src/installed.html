          Check and modify whitelist settings by clicking at the addon icon in addon bar and select "Change settings...".
          By default all pages are allowed but it's recommended to limit the pages where the addon can add the local link behaviour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Test the addon at your pages or at this <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/awolf2904/tefcs74q/" target="_blank">Jsfiddle</a>.

      <h3>Additional information</h3>
      <h4>Why do I get a warning that my computer was protected by Windows? <a href="#" data-target="warningInfo" class="toggle">Show answer</a></h4>
      <div id="warningInfo" class="info-container">
        <p>
          At the moment, the Windows installer is not signed that's why you're getting the message. Signing is planned but not ready yet. You can install the app if you're clicking on show more information and afterwards click on the new button "run anyway".<br/>
          Below you see that message in Windows 10:

          If you're concerned about security then you can do the following to be sure that everything is as usual:
          <ul>
            <li>Check that the installer is downloaded from github repo by hovering over the download links above for your OS. Repo link <a href="https://github.com/AWolf81/webextension_local_filesystem_links-native-host-binaries">AWolf81/webextension_local_filesystem_links-native-host-binaries</a></li>
            <li>Run your virus scanner on the downloaded file before executing</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Why do I need to install a program? <a href="#" data-target="info" class="toggle">Show answer</a></h4>
      <div id="info" class="info-container">
        <p>
          In previous versions of Firefox (before FF 57) it was possible to access the
          local filesystem with the browser API. That's not supported anymore and it
          is similar to other browsers (e.g. Chrome has also this restriction).
        </p>
        <p>
          To make this extension possible we need a way to interact with the file system again.
          This is possible with a native application that communicates with the browser with an API. It's called native messaging.
          The application will use the system file explorer (e.g. on Windows - it's Windows Explorer)
          to open the application in your linked application.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Whitelist needs to be according to new schema e.g. *://*.jsfiddle.net/*</h4>
      <p>The new format is &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;host&gt;&lt;path&gt; (wildcard char * is possible)<br/>
      A single * will be replaced with &lt;all_urls&gt; by the extension.
      Please have a look at the following docs. for more details about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Match_patterns">match patterns</a>
      </p>
      <h4>How can I whitelist a server with a port e.g. servername:8080?</h4>
      <p>Just add it with-out the port and it will be correctly handled. e.g. http://servername/*</p>
