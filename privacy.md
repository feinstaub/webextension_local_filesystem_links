# Privacy Policy for the Local Filesystem Link Extension

This privacy policy details the data practices of the Local Filesystem Link extension.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

The Local Filesystem Link extension does not collect, use, or share any personal data from its users. It operates entirely locally on your browser, without communicating with external servers or services. The extension does not gather or store any personally identifiable information or any other type of data from its users.

## 2. Permissions

To facilitate its core functionalities, the extension requires permissions to alter the browser's behavior, enabling it to open local files such as `c:/textfile.txt` or any UNC path from user-whitelisted URLs. Despite necessitating these permissions, the extension doesn’t engage in the collection or transmission of personal data.

## 3. User Control

Users maintain the authority to dictate the URLs where the extension remains active, by leveraging a white-listing feature. This function operates locally and does not involve the transfer or sharing of data with external entities.

## 4. Disclosure to Websites

The extension adds a click handler and an icon next to eligible links, a feature that can be toggled in the extension’s options. Due to this, websites can technically detect the presence of the extension. This addition enhances user interaction without collecting or conveying any personal information to the websites.

## 5. Data Security

Since the extension does not engage in the collection or storage of personal data, it does not incorporate data security measures pertaining to the protection of personal data.

## 6. Changes to the Privacy Policy

We hold the rights to update this privacy policy periodically. Despite the non-involvement in data collection, we may refine this policy to maintain alignment with regulatory requisites and ensure transparency with our users.
