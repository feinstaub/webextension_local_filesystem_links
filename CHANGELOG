**Available Features**
First compatible version with webextension stlye that's required for FF >= 57. A large re-write of the background scripts and a new native app (currently supporting Linux & Windows - iOS planned) was necessary.

** Missing features (added in future release) **
* [MISSING]: Native app support for MacOS (extension not usable at MacOS with-out the app - probably easy to implement but I don't have access to a test setup with that OS. Still trying to install OSx in VM ware.)
* [MISSING]: Right click context menu

* [MISSING]: In browser opening option (e.g. show supported types directly in Firefox like images, PDFs,...)

    Links are still added to invisible links because handling of later addition seems too complicated.

    Files like jpg, txt, pdf, etc. can be directly opened in browser - accessible with context menu or
    by default link behaviour change
* NEW: Environment path variables are supported e.g. %HOMEDRIVE% for Windows and $HOME$ for Linux -
    Note: Links with env. var needs to use %25 for % and %24 for $ in href attr. (will be improved later)
